Applied Machine Learning coursework at McGill University.

Project 1 - Machine Learning 101

Implement of two linear classification techniques—logistic regression and linear discriminant analysis (LDA)—and run these two algorithms on two distinct datasets. Other techniques include loading and cleaning the data set, extracting some basic additional features and using K-fold validation to evaluate the models.

Project 2 - Reddit Classification

Develop models to analyze text from the website Reddit (https://www.reddit.com), a popular social media forum where users post and comment on content in different themed commu- nities, or subreddits. The goal of this project is to develop a supervised classification model that can predict what community a comment came from 

Project 3 - Modified MNIST Image Classification

Perform an image analysis prediction challenge. The task is based upon the MNIST dataset (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database). The original MNIST contains handwritten numeric digits from 0-9 and the goal is to classify which digit is present in an image.

Project 4 - Reproduce the results of a published machine learning paper
Implement and improve the baselines
